## Land Acknowledgement

The University of Michigan's origins are in a land grant from the Anishinaabeg (including Odawa, Ojibwe, and Boodewadomi) and Wyandot. I further acknowledge that our university stands, like almost all property in the United States, on lands obtained, generally in unconscionable ways, from indigenous peoples. Knowing where we live and work does not change the past, but a thorough understanding of the ongoing consequences of this past can empower us in our research, teaching, and outreach to create a future that supports human flourishing and justice for all individuals. If you'd like to learn more about land acknowledgements, I'd encourage you to give [this](https://nativegov.org/news/a-guide-to-indigenous-land-acknowledgment/) a read.
