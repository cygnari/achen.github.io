Hello! I'm Anthony, a PhD student at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. I am advised by [Robert Krasny](http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~krasny/), [Christiane Jablonowski](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~cjablono/), and [Brian Arbic](https://arbic.earth.lsa.umich.edu/).

I have at times been described as a coastal elite; I do not take offense to this characterization. My favorite chocolate comes from the Oro de Cacao in Zurich, Switzerland. My favorite animal is the penguin; I almost took a selfie with one while I was in Antarctica. My heart yearns for crashing waves and salty sea breeze. I believe that fanfiction is a valuable form of media, and have been an avid consumer of fan works for the past ten or so years. I have also been playing gacha games in one form or another for the past ten years. The latest I've ever woken up is 8:30 am.

## Current Research Interests

## Land Acknowledgement

The University of Michigan's origins are in a land grant from the Anishinaabeg (including Odawa, Ojibwe, and Boodewadomi) and Wyandot. I further acknowledge that our university stands, like almost all property in the United States, on lands obtained, generally in unconscionable ways, from indigenous peoples. Knowing where we live and work does not change the past, but a thorough understanding of the ongoing consequences of this past can empower us in our research, teaching, and outreach to create a future that supports human flourishing and justice for all individuals. If you'd like to learn more about land acknowledgements, I'd encourage you to give [this](https://nativegov.org/news/a-guide-to-indigenous-land-acknowledgment/) a read.
