Hello! I'm Anthony, a PhD student at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. I am advised by [Robert Krasny](http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~krasny/), [Christiane Jablonowski](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~cjablono/), and [Brian Arbic](https://arbic.earth.lsa.umich.edu/). My PhD is in applied mathematics and scientific computing with a focus on numerical techniques for problems arising in atmospheric and oceanic modeling.

I have at times been described as a coastal elite; I do not take offense to this characterization. My favorite chocolate comes from the Oro de Cacao in Zurich, Switzerland. My favorite animal is the penguin; I almost took a selfie with one while I was in Antarctica. My heart yearns for crashing waves and salty sea breeze. I believe that fanfiction is a valuable form of media, and have been an avid consumer of fan works for the past ten or so years. I have also been playing gacha games in one form or another for the past ten years. The latest I've ever woken up is 8:30 am. My favorite matrix decomposition is the SVD.

## Some Upcoming Conferences
* None in the near future

## Some Hobbies
* Photography and travel: Japan for 2 weeks in December and January
* Video games: currently playing _Ensemble Stars!!_ and _[Fallen London](https://www.fallenlondon.com/profile/Acamar)_
* Reading: I highly recommend _[Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint](https://orv-epub.carrd.co/)_ and _[Overgeared](https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/overgeared)_
* Anime: find me on [anilist](https://anilist.co/user/angetenar/)
* I play some piano, occasionally, maybe
* Cooking: contemplating sweet and spicy baklava

## Other Things I Have Feelings About
* Urbanism, cities, public transportation
* Aviation, global connectivity: see my [flight logs](https://openflights.org/user/cygnari)

## Land Acknowledgement

The University of Michigan (deriving from mishigami, Ojibwe for 'great water'), sits on the traditional land of the Anishinaabe, which was ceded through the Treaty of Fort Meigs by the Anishinaabeg (including Odawa, Ojibwe, and Boodewadomi) and Wyandot. While ostensibly consensual, this Treaty was part of a larger effort by the US federal government to remove Native Americans from the Great Lakes, and economic, social, and political pressure was put on indigenous peoples to consent against their own self-interest. Knowing where we live and work does not change the past, but a thorough understanding of the ongoing consequences of this past can empower us in our research, teaching, and outreach to create a future that supports human flourishing and justice for all individuals. If you'd like to learn more about land acknowledgements, I'd encourage you to give [this](https://nativegov.org/news/a-guide-to-indigenous-land-acknowledgment/) a read.

In addition, as someone working on research tangentially related to climate change, I feel that it is important to acknowledge that Native Americans and other Indigenous Peoples are among the most effective groups are conserving and sustainably managing the land that we all live and depend on, and have long modeled sustainable land management techniques that we can all learn from. Indigenous land rights are a critical pillar of climate action, and good land (forests, especially) management is essential in the fight against climate change. If you want to learn more about traditional and indigenous ecological and environmental knowledge, then [this article](https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/52/5/432/236145) may be a good place to start.
