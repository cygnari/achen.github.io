The barotropic vorticity equations describe the conservation of absolute vorticity for a fluid on a rotating sphere. When transformed appropriately, one can rewrite these with a Biot-Savart integral, and with a Lagrangian discretization, one can arrive at a discretized system with an update taking the form of a N-body sum. In this talk, I present a fast summation technique that reduces the asymptotic complexity of this sum from $O(N^2)$ to $O(N\log{N})$ with a new spherical tree code, suitable for a wide range of problems in geophysical fluid dynamics.
